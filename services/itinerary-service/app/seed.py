            "If you only see one monument in Yaoundé, make it this one — it is the closest thing "
            "Cameroon has to a national statement carved in concrete.\n\n"
            "The story it tells begins in 1919. After Germany lost the First World War, its colony of "
            "Kamerun was split between France and Britain. For four decades two Cameroons existed side "
            "by side: a larger French-administered territory and a smaller British Southern Cameroons. "
            "On 1 October 1961, following a plebiscite, Southern Cameroons joined the newly independent "
            "Republic of Cameroon. In 1972 the federation was dissolved and the United Republic of "
            "Cameroon was born.\n\n"
            "President Ahmadou Ahidjo wanted that moment fixed in the landscape and launched a national "
            "and international design competition. Three names came out of it: Engelbert Mveng, the "
            "Cameroonian Jesuit priest, historian and artist who conceived the spiral tower and the "
            "cultural reliefs; Armand Salomon, the French architect who built the main structure; and "
            "Gédéon Mpando, the Cameroonian sculptor behind the statue. Construction ran roughly from "
            "1973 to 1976.\n\n"
            "Read the monument like a text. The tower is two spirals climbing and fusing at the summit — "
            "often described as two serpents whose heads merge — the two Cameroons becoming one. Inside "
            "the cone, pillars carry reliefs by Mveng representing the cultural areas of the country: "
            "north, south, east and west. Beside it stands Mpando's sculpture, some seven metres tall "
            "and cast in around fifty-three tonnes of concrete: an old man raising the national torch, "
            "children clinging to him on both sides. The elder is the generation that fought for "
            "reunification; the children are the generations inheriting it, girls deliberately given "
            "equal place with boys.\n\n"
            "The monument is not a neutral object today. The unity it celebrates has been strained by "
            "the Anglophone crisis in the North-West and South-West regions since 2016, and Cameroonians "
            "argue about what the spiral now means. That argument is part of the site: you are standing "

            "National Assembly and the hotels built for visiting delegations. Culturally, it is one of "
            "the few places in Yaoundé where you can catch a full orchestral concert, a national dance "

            "The site first served as the residence of Major Hans Dominik, who commanded the German "
            "military post at Yaoundé during the protectorate. After the First World War, when Germany "
            "lost its colonies, the French took over the plot, and in 1930 the French governor Théodore "
            "Marchand built his residence there. Through the late 1940s it housed a succession of French "

            "Mebe received Vieter and gave him land on the hill of Mvolyé, and there the first Catholic "
            "mission of Yaoundé was planted.\n\n"

            "beside Vieter, and there too that the funeral of the paramount chief Charles Atangana was "
